This program compares the performance of recursive and iterative implementations of the insertion sort sorting algorithm 
using the Java programming language. 

This algorithm can take an array of integers and sort them in ascending order. 

Please see the README.pdf for a detailed analysis. 

A CSV file will be created on the user's desktop upon running the program.
